# StrangerLights
Stranger Things-inspired RGB LED program for Particle Photon.  Slowly lights LEDs one at a time with creepy flickering effects.

## Supplies needed:
* Strand of WS2811 RGB LED lights (looks nice if the wire is green)
* Particle Photon microcontroller (this program can be easily converted for ordinary Arduino)
* USB 5v wall plug for the Photon
* Optional high current 5V power supply for LEDS
* various jumper wires
